**Bombay Beach**:  No significant instrument or data issues.  California Air Resources Board (CARB) performed an audit on the meteorological and air quality stations on 1/11/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specified limits.

**Naval Test Base**:  The net radiation sensor failed its audit/calibration at deployment on 10/14/2016.  Thus, net radiation data from the meteorological station are invalid until repairs are made or the sensor is replaced and passes audits.  Issues with sensors resulted in the invalidation of delta temperature data from 1/10/2017 to 1/29/2017; the delta temperature issue appears to have been resolved after station repairs.  CARB performed station audit activities on the meteorological and air quality stations on 1/10/2017 and 1/11/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specific limits (note that net radiation was not audited by CARB).

**Salton City**:  No significant instrument or data issues.  CARB performed a station audit on the meteorological and air quality stations on 1/10/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specified limits.

**Salton Sea Park**:  No significant instrument or data issues at the meteorological station.  CARB performed an audit on the meteorological station on 1/11/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specified limits.  All data from the air quality station for January are invalid as the result of ongoing air quality station issues and associated TEOM status errors.

**Sonny Bono**:  The net radiation sensor failed its audit/calibration at deployment on 10/4/2016.  Thus, net radiation data from the meteorological station are invalid until repairs are made or the sensor is replaced and passes audits.  A data logger issue resulted in the loss of all meteorological and TEOM data from 1/17/2017 to 1/24/2017; the issue has been resolved.  Instrument/wiring issues resulted in the invalidation of delta temperature data from 1/10/2017 to 1/31/2017; the delta temperature issue appears to have been resolved after station repairs on 2/3/2017.  TEOM data were invalidated from 1/30/2017 to 1/31/2017 as the result of TEOM operation mode errors.  CARB performed station audit activities on the meteorological and air quality stations on 1/10/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specific limits (note that net radiation was not audited by CARB).

**Torres-Martinez**:  The net radiation sensor failed its audit/calibration at deployment on 12/31/2016.  Thus, net radiation data from the meteorological station are invalid until repairs are made or the sensor is replaced and passes audits.  CARB performed station audit activities on the meteorological and air quality stations on 1/12/2017 and their preliminary audit report indicates that all instruments/parameters are within their specific limits (note that net radiation was not audited by CARB).  From 1/7/2017 to 1/12/2017, TEOM data were invalidated due to TEOM status errors; the issue appears to have been resolved after station repairs on 1/12/2017.
